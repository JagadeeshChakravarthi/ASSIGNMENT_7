5. What string method can be used to convert string into array ?

Ans:
split() method: This method splits a string into an array of substrings. 
The split() method returns the new array. 
The split() method does not change the original string. 
If (" ") is used as separator, the string is split between words.

proof:

let string = "This is a string";
let array = string.split(" ");

console.log(array); // ["This", "is", "a", "string"]
